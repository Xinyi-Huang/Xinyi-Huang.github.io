### What is Science on Tap? 

An online symposium to share popular science with the broader range other than existing researchers. 
They were held weekly during 2021, and provided multiple topics from social science, biology, mechanical engineering, etc, mainly in Chinese. 
Xinyi serves as an active speaker, and she usually uses multiple sources to explain the topic. 
No recordings are available. 
These figures were used only for educational purposes.
