The Leidenforst effect is found in the 18th Century, where a liquid is placed on a surface significantly hotter than its boiling point, but the it takes long to become fully vapour due to a foam of vapour beneath.

### What is Science on Tap? 

An online symposium to share popular science with the broader range other than existing researchers. 
They were held weekly during 2021, and provided multiple topics from social science, biology, mechanical engineering, etc, mainly in Chinese. 
Xinyi serves as an active speaker, and she usually uses multiple sources to explain the topic. 
No recordings are available. 
These figures were used only for educational purposes.
